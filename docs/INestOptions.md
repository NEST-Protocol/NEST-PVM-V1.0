    /// @param offset Skip previous (offset) records
    /// @param count Return (count) records
    /// @param order Order. 0 reverse order, non-0 positive order
    /// @return optionArray Matched option array
    function list(uint offset, uint count, uint order) external view returns (OptionView[] memory optionArray);
```

### 2.2. Obtain the number of European options that have been opened

```javascript
    /// @dev Obtain the number of European options that have been opened
    /// @return Number of European options opened
    function getOptionCount() external view returns (uint);
```

### 2.3. Open option

```javascript
    /// @dev Open option
    /// @param tokenAddress Target token address, 0 means eth
    /// @param strikePrice The exercise price set by the user. During settlement, the system will compare the 
    /// current price of the subject matter with the exercise price to calculate the user's profit and loss
    /// @param orientation true: call, false: put
    /// @param exerciseBlock After reaching this block, the user will exercise manually, and the block will be
    /// recorded in the system using the block number
    /// @param nestAmount Amount of paid NEST
    function open(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint strikePrice,
        bool orientation,
        uint exerciseBlock,
        uint nestAmount
    ) external payable;
```
Note: This method will triggers the Open event, See also 3.1.

### 2.4. Exercise option

```javascript
    /// @dev Exercise option
    /// @param index Index of option
    /// @param amount Amount of option to exercise

    /// @dev Estimate the amount of option
    /// @param tokenAddress Target token address, 0 means eth
    /// @param oraclePrice Current price from oracle
    /// @param strikePrice The exercise price set by the user. During settlement, the system will compare the 
    /// current price of the subject matter with the exercise price to calculate the user's profit and loss
    /// @param orientation true: call, false: put
    /// @param exerciseBlock After reaching this block, the user will exercise manually, and the block will be
    /// recorded in the system using the block number
    /// @param nestAmount Amount of paid NEST
    /// @return amount Amount of option
    function estimate(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint oraclePrice,
        uint strikePrice,
        bool orientation,
        uint exerciseBlock,
        uint nestAmount
    ) external view returns (uint amount);
```

### 2.6. Find the options of the owner (in reverse order)

```javascript
    /// @dev Find the options of the owner (in reverse order)

    /// @param count Maximum number of records returned
    /// @param maxFindCount Find records at most
    /// @param owner Target address
    /// @return optionArray Matched options
    function find(
        uint start, 
        uint count, 
        uint maxFindCount, 
        address owner
    ) external view returns (OptionView[] memory optionArray);
```

### 2.7. Sell option

```javascript
    /// @dev Sell option
    /// @param index Index of option
    /// @param amount Amount of option to sell
    function sell(uint index, uint amount) external payable;

### 2.8. Calculate option price

```javascript
    /// @dev Calculate option price
    /// @param oraclePrice Current price from oracle

    /// recorded in the system using the block number
    /// @return v Option price. Need to divide (USDT_BASE << 64)
    function calcV(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint oraclePrice,
        uint strikePrice,
        bool orientation,
        uint exerciseBlock
    ) external view returns (uint v);
```

## 3. Event Description
